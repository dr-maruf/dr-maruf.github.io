## Overview

The **EVIDENT** (Ex Vivo Determined Cancer Therapy) project, funded by the Commonwealth PhD Scholarship (£158,685) and a UKRI Knowledge Exchange Fund grant (£10,890.67), developed a comprehensive ex vivo drug efficacy screening platform for solid cancers — with a primary focus on melanoma. The platform integrates biosample processing, 2D and 3D tumour spheroid culture, high-content imaging, and machine learning to predict individual patient responses to targeted and immune therapies.

## Key Activities

- **Platform Development** — Developed end-to-end SOPs for solid tumour biosample collection, thermal chain maintenance, ex vivo processing, drug application, data recording, and long-term liquid nitrogen storage; mock runs and QC protocols implemented throughout
- **2D & 3D Cell Culture Models** — Established and optimised conventional monolayer and patient-derived tumour spheroid/3D co-culture systems; resolved early challenges in spheroid formation through collaboration with Misvik Biology (Finland) and Nanobug-Oncology (Sheffield), and by conducting targeted literature review
- **High-Content Imaging & Spatial Analysis** — Applied fluorescence microscopy and spatial imaging to quantify cell viability, morphology, and drug response across multiple assay conditions; used Biorender for graphical abstracts and illustrations
- **Machine Learning for Image Analysis** — Trained a VGG19-based deep neural network for automated classification of biological imaging data; developed image analysis protocols in collaboration with Dr. Jamie Adams (UoS)
- **Multivariate Statistical Modelling** — Conducted multivariate analysis on observational clinical and experimental data to identify predictors of drug response; completed multiple R analysis courses to support statistical work
- **Knowledge Exchange & Grant Writing** — Wrote and secured a competitive UKRI Knowledge Exchange Fund grant application; gained experience in academia-enterprise collaboration, intellectual property rights, and commercialisation principles
