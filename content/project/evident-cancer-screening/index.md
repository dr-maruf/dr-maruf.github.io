## Overview

The **EVIDENT** (Ex Vivo Determined Cancer Therapy) project, funded by the Commonwealth PhD Scholarship (£158,685) and a UKRI Knowledge Exchange Fund grant (£10,890.67), developed a comprehensive ex vivo drug efficacy screening platform for solid cancers — with a focus on melanoma. The platform integrates biosample processing, 2D and 3D cell culture, high-content imaging, and machine learning to predict individual patient responses to targeted and immune therapies.

## Key Activities

- **Platform Development** — Developed end-to-end SOPs for solid tumour biosample collection, thermal chain maintenance, ex vivo processing, drug application, data recording, and long-term liquid nitrogen storage; included mock runs and QC protocols for stored samples and lab results
- **2D & 3D Cell Culture Models** — Established and optimised both conventional monolayer and patient-derived organoid/3D culture systems for drug efficacy assessment under physiologically relevant conditions
- **High-Content Imaging & Spatial Analysis** — Applied fluorescence microscopy and spatial imaging to quantify cell viability, morphology, and drug response across multiple assay conditions
- **Machine Learning for Image Analysis** — Trained a VGG19-based deep neural network for automated classification of biological imaging data, improving throughput and reproducibility of drug response quantification
- **Multivariate Statistical Modelling** — Conducted multivariate analysis on observational clinical and experimental data to identify predictors of drug response and patient outcomes
- **Knowledge Exchange** — Led translation activities with clinical partners under the UKRI Knowledge Exchange Fund, including a feasibility study for melanoma clinical deployment

## Outputs & Awards

- 🏆 **BACR/AstraZeneca Student Award** (2023) — Travel grant to present at ESMO Congress, Barcelona
- 🏆 **UKRI Knowledge Exchange Fund** (2023) — £10,890.67 for EVIDENT melanoma feasibility study
- 🏆 **Commonwealth PhD Scholarship** — £158,685 (2021–2025)
