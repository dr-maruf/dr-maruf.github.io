## Overview

As part of the Centre for Medical Biotechnology's national program development mandate, this project series conducted feasibility assessments and operational planning for national population screening programs across Bangladesh, encompassing congenital hypothyroidism, HIV, Hepatitis B, and thalassaemia.

## Key Activities

- **Feasibility Study Design** — Developed feasibility study frameworks and evidence-based policy options for implementing national newborn and population screening programs within Bangladesh's existing health system infrastructure
- **Dried Blood Spot (DBS) Workflow Development** — Designed SOPs for dried blood spot tissue collection, processing, data recording, disposal, and appropriate storage for congenital hypothyroidism screening; coordinated mock runs to validate workflow feasibility
- **HIV, HepB & Thalassaemia Screening Planning** — Developed operational planning frameworks covering sample collection logistics, biosafety protocols, laboratory processing, and quality control for blood-borne and genetic disease screening programs
- **Policy Options Analysis** — Synthesised findings into structured policy briefs and recommendations for Ministry of Health decision-makers on program feasibility, phased rollout strategy, and resource requirements
- **Thalassaemia Burden Study** — Contributed to a study on thalassaemia diagnosis, optimal treatment, outcomes, and socio-economic consequences in Bangladesh
- **Stakeholder Coordination** — Collaborated with Ministry of Health leadership, laboratory directors, and international partners on program design and scale-up planning

## Impact

Provided the Ministry of Health with an evidence base and operational roadmap for phased rollout of national screening programs, with direct implications for early detection, treatment access, and reduction of preventable disease burden.
