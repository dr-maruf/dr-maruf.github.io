## Overview

This research project — completed as an MSc dissertation at the **University of Sheffield** (Distinction, 2019), supervised by [Dr Andrew Chantry](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew-Chantry) — conducted a service evaluation and health economic assessment of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) at a UK transplant centre. A central focus was the applicability and transferability of HRQoL findings to developing nation contexts.

This work established a strong foundation in PROM-based outcome modelling, later applied to broader health system performance measurement roles.

## Key Activities

- **PROM Framework Design** — Developed and validated a patient-reported outcome questionnaire integrating both quantitative (HRQoL scales) and qualitative components for transplant recipients
- **Patient Data Collection** — Conducted structured patient interviews and collected longitudinal outcome data following informed consent procedures
- **Health Economic Analysis** — Performed cost-effectiveness and HRQoL analysis of HSCT services at the UK centre, benchmarking against international standards
- **Cross-population Applicability Analysis** — Assessed the transferability of evaluation methodology and findings to healthcare settings in lower-resource and diverse populations
- **SOP Development** — Contributed to SOPs for patient participation, consent, and ethical oversight in clinical research settings

## Impact

Awarded **Distinction**. Findings contributed to understanding of HSCT service evaluation methodology with implications for global applicability, informing subsequent work on PROM-based health system evaluation frameworks in international settings.
