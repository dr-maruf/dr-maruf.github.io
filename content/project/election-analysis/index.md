## Overview

This independent data science project applied statistical and spatial analysis techniques to investigate the relationship between socio-demographic factors — including income, education, age distribution, and urban/rural divide — and voting patterns in Bangladesh's national elections. The analysis was written up as an op-ed exploring the data-driven story behind electoral behaviour.

## Key Activities

- **Data Acquisition & Wrangling** — Compiled and cleaned publicly available electoral results data alongside demographic datasets (census, survey-based) for cross-referenced analysis
- **Socio-demographic Correlation Analysis** — Applied statistical methods to identify significant associations between demographic variables and constituency-level voting patterns across multiple election cycles
- **Geospatial Visualisation** — Created data visualisations mapping electoral outcomes against socio-demographic indicators at the district and sub-district level
- **Science Communication** — Translated analytical findings into an accessible, evidence-based op-ed for general and policy audiences, demonstrating the value of data-driven interpretation in civic discourse

## Impact

Published as an op-ed generating public discussion on evidence-based interpretation of electoral behaviour and the role of socio-demographic factors in shaping political outcomes in Bangladesh.
