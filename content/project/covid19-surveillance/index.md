## Overview

As **Deputy Program Manager – Health Information Systems & eHealth** at the Centre for Medical Biotechnology, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Bangladesh, this project led the development and national rollout of an integrated COVID-19 surveillance, vaccine deployment, and genomic monitoring system covering a population of over 170 million.

## Key Activities

- **Surveillance System Architecture** — Designed and implemented the national COVID-19 case surveillance and reporting framework, including real-time dashboards for risk zone distribution and policy decisions
- **Biosample Surveillance & Genome Analysis** — Coordinated a national COVID-19 biosample surveillance and SARS-CoV-2 genomic analysis workflow: developed SOPs, conducted mock runs, ensured biosafety protocols, oversaw sample collection, processing (including ultra-low freezer storage), and bioinformatic analysis through GISAID and national databases
- **Vaccine Deployment Planning** — Led national COVID-19 vaccine deployment and preparedness planning, including cold chain logistics and stakeholder coordination
- **SARS-CoV-2 Variant Analysis** — Conducted bioinformatic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomic variants circulating in Bangladesh, producing molecular characterization reports used in national policy
- **Stakeholder Engagement** — Coordinated across WHO, UNICEF, UNDP, and national government directorates; prepared public communication materials and advocacy campaigns

## Impact

Provided the analytical backbone for COVID-19 policy decisions affecting 170+ million citizens. Genomic variant data directly informed national vaccine and public health response strategy.

## Selected Output

- Rahman, Md.M., et al. (2021). *Molecular characterization of SARS-CoV-2 variants in Bangladesh*
- National COVID-19 Health Bulletin (Managing Contributor)
