## About Me
<div align="justify">I am a physician from Bangladesh, currently working as Doctoral Researcher in Oncology and Metabolism at the University of Sheffield exploring personalized drug efficacy assessment to improve outcomes of advanced solid tumours. I have a multidisciplinary expertise and skillset in health disciplines ranging from molecular medicine to broader public health areas including health program evaluation and disease epidemiology. 

My former role as Deputy Program Manager at the Management Information System division of the Ministry of Health adn Family Welfare, Bangladesh I played a key role as a technical lead and  coordinator for the National COVID-19 surveillance and other routine health data systems including several national disease screening programs. I co-founded the largest social forum of Bangaladeshi doctors and medical students, Platform Doctor's Society where the members are working tirelessly in collaboration with government and non-government bodies in managing national emergency and crisis response, health policy evaluation and activism for physician and patient rights . My career and academic experience allow me to evaluate health issues both vertically focussing in-depth on specialized single events and horizontally focussing on multifactorial determinants and crosstalks.

Outside my core academic and work focus, I am an advocate for scientific and rational medical practice. I develop contents for effective science communication debunking myths arround health issues.</div>
