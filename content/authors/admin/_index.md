## About Me

<div align="justify">I am a healthcare decision scientist and physician-researcher with over 10 years of experience translating complex health data into evidence-based recommendations for senior decision-makers. Currently serving as Senior Performance Measurement Specialist at the Saskatchewan Ministry of Health, I review analytical outputs, critically appraise data visualizations, and prepare data-backed policy recommendations across Continuing Care, Mental Health & Addictions, and Acute Care programs.

I hold a PhD in Medicine from the University of Sheffield (award pending), where I applied statistical modelling, machine learning, and clinical data analysis to personalized cancer therapy research. My earlier role as Deputy Program Manager for Health Information Systems at Bangladesh's Ministry of Health saw me lead national COVID-19 surveillance systems and facility-level performance evaluation frameworks across 450+ healthcare facilities in collaboration with WHO, UNICEF, and UNDP.

My core competencies span predictive modelling and statistical inference, advanced analytics (R, Python, Tableau, Power BI), health system performance measurement, and AI/agentic systems — including building custom AI agents using Microsoft Copilot Studio and the Claude API. I bring a cross-organizational perspective, strong stakeholder engagement skills, and a deep commitment to evidence-based, patient-centred healthcare improvement.

Beyond my professional roles, I am an active science communicator — sharing microscopy-based scientific artworks and health commentary on social media, presenting webinars on research ethics and higher study pathways, and serving on the editorial board of a clinical journal in Bangladesh. I have presented my research at 9 national and international conferences (including ESMO 2023 in Madrid and the Commonwealth PhD Conference at Windsor), and peer-review for journals including IJID Regions (Elsevier). I am also exploring postdoctoral opportunities at Canadian universities and actively communicating with research groups in my areas of interest.</div>
