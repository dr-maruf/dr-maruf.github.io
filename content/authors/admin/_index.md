    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a physician from Bangladesh with a multidisciplinary experience in clinical health, public health, science communication, and molecular biology. I am currently exploring ex-vivo theragnostic models for personalized cancer therapy in solid tumors as a Ph.D. student at the University of Sheffield, UK.
