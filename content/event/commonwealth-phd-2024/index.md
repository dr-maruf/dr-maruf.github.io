summary: Oral presentation on ex vivo 3D spheroid drug screening models for personalised melanoma immunotherapy, delivered at the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission annual PhD conference.

abstract: |
  This oral presentation discussed the development and optimisation of ex vivo 3D tumour spheroid models as a platform for precision immunotherapy screening in melanoma. The work demonstrated how patient-derived spheroids, combined with deep learning image analysis (VGG19), enable high-throughput assessment of drug responses — paving the way for personalised treatment selection. Data from the EVIDENT study at the University of Sheffield were presented.

**Talk type:** Oral Presentation

**Event:** Commonwealth Scholarship Commission PhD Conference 2024

**Venue:** Windsor, United Kingdom · June 2024

This was an oral presentation delivered at the annual PhD conference hosted by the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission (UK). The talk covered the EVIDENT project — a University of Sheffield PhD study developing ex vivo 3D tumour spheroid models for precision immunotherapy screening in melanoma, integrating computer vision (VGG19 deep learning), multivariate statistics (PCA, mixed-effects models), and flow cytometry.
