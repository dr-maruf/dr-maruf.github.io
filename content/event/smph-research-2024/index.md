summary: Oral presentation at the School of Medicine and Population Health Annual Research Meeting, presenting deep learning-based analysis of ex vivo spheroid drug response in melanoma.

abstract: |
  Presented findings from the EVIDENT PhD project: a VGG19 convolutional neural network pipeline for automated cell viability classification in ex vivo 3D melanoma spheroids treated with targeted and immunotherapy agents. Results demonstrated significant differences in drug response profiles between patient-derived tumour samples, supporting a precision medicine approach to melanoma treatment selection.

**Talk type:** Oral Presentation

**Event:** School of Medicine and Population Health (SMPH) Annual Research Meeting 2024

**Venue:** University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK · June 2024

Oral presentation at the annual research showcase of the School of Medicine and Population Health, University of Sheffield. The talk focused on the computational pipeline developed for the EVIDENT project — specifically the application of transfer learning (VGG19) to classify live/dead/stressed cell populations in fluorescence-imaged 3D spheroids exposed to melanoma therapies.
