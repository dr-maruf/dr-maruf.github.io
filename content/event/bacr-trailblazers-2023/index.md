summary: Poster presentation at the BACR Trailblazers in Cancer Research meeting for early-career cancer researchers.

abstract: |
  Poster describing a novel ex vivo drug screening pipeline using patient-derived 3D tumour spheroids as a personalised oncology tool. The platform enables drug efficacy testing on intact tumour architecture derived directly from patient biopsies, preserving cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions lost in 2D cultures. Outcome metrics included fluorescence-based cell viability, spheroid morphology, and growth inhibition ratios.
