abstract: |
  Poster presenting the use of patient-derived 3D tumour spheroid models as tools to study the tumour microenvironment (TME) in melanoma. The work highlighted how ex vivo spheroids recapitulate key TME features including hypoxic core formation, stromal cell interactions, and immune cell exclusion — properties relevant to immunotherapy resistance.
