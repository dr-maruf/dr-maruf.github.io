abstract: "This review examines the landscape of in-vitro assays used for immuno-oncology drug efficacy assessment and personalized cancer therapy screening. We discuss the scopes, limitations, and future directions of ex vivo and in vitro methodologies including 2D and 3D culture models, high-content imaging, and functional drug screening platforms for predicting individual patient responses to targeted and immune therapies in solid tumours."
