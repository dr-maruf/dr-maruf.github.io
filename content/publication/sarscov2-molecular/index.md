abstract: "This study presents a molecular characterization of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using bioinformatic analysis of genomic sequences obtained from national surveillance and GISAID, we investigated genetic diversity, possible origin of variants, and the functional significance of key mutations for public health and vaccine strategy."

summary: "Bioinformatic molecular characterization of SARS-CoV-2 variants in Bangladesh, analyzing genetic diversity, variant origins, and functional significance of mutations."
